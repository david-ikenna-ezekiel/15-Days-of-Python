# Day 12: Modules and Packages

## Overview
On Day 12, we’ll explore modules and packages, which help you organize code into reusable components. You’ll learn how to import and use both built-in and external modules, create your own modules, and understand package structure. By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to effectively organize code for larger projects.

## Topics Covered
1. **Understanding and Using Modules**
   - **Importing Modules**: Using `import` to bring in functionality from existing modules.
   - **Aliasing**: Using `as` to create an alias for a module (e.g., `import numpy as np`).
   - **Creating Custom Modules**: Writing your own modules and importing them into other scripts.

2. **Understanding Packages and Their Structure**
   - Organizing multiple modules into packages.
   - Creating a package directory with an `__init__.py` file to group related modules.
   - Importing from packages with `from package import module`.

3. **Installing and Using External Packages with pip**
   - Installing packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using `pip`.
   - Using popular external packages in Python, such as `requests` for HTTP requests or `pandas` for data manipulation.

4. **Exploring the Python Standard Library**
   - Overview of useful modules in the standard library, such as `math`, `datetime`, and `os`.
   - Practical examples of using standard library modules to simplify common tasks.

## Practical Examples
- **example_12_01.py** - Creating and Using a Custom Module
- **example_12_02.py** - Using an External Package

## Quick Exercise
- **excercise_12_01.py** - Write a Python script that uses a custom module to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and handles division by zero gracefully.

## Further Practice
1. Organize multiple custom modules into a package with an `__init__.py` file.
2. Explore and use the `math` and `datetime` modules in practical applications.
