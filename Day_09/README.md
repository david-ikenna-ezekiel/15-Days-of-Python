# Day 09: Functions

## Overview
On Day 9, we’ll explore functions, which are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Functions help make your code more organized, modular, and easy to understand. Today, you’ll learn how to define functions, work with parameters, return values, and understand variable scope.

## Topics Covered
1. **Understanding and Defining Functions**
   - What functions are and why they are useful.
   - Defining a function using the `def` keyword.
   - Writing function docstrings to document what a function does.

2. **Using Parameters, Arguments, and Default Parameters**
   - Passing information to functions using parameters and arguments.
   - Using default parameters to set default values for arguments.
   - Understanding the difference between positional and keyword arguments.

3. **Returning Values from Functions**
   - Using `return` to send results back to the caller of the function.
   - Understanding how returned values can be used in expressions and stored in variables.

4. **Scope and Lifetime of Variables**
   - Understanding local and global variables.
   - Learning about the scope and lifetime of variables inside and outside functions.

## Practical Examples
- **example_09_01.py** - Calculating Factorial of Numbers
- **example_09_02.py** - Checking if a number is Prime

## Quick Exercise
- **excercise_09_01.py** - Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the largest number in the list.

## Further Practice
1. Write a function that takes a number and returns its square.
2. Create a function that greets a user by name, with an optional default name.
3. Write a function that calculates the area of a rectangle using length and width parameters.
4. Experiment with variable scope by creating variables inside and outside of functions and observing the results.
