# Day 10: Working with Strings

## Overview
On Day 10, we’ll focus on strings, one of the most commonly used data types in Python. Strings are used to store and manipulate text. Today, you’ll learn how to create and manipulate strings, perform operations like concatenation and formatting, and apply strings in real-world examples.

## Topics Covered
1. **Understanding and Using Strings**
   - Creating strings using quotes.
   - Accessing characters in a string using indexing.
   - Extracting parts of strings with slicing.
   - Using common string methods, such as `upper()`, `lower()`, `find()`, `replace()`, and `strip()`.

2. **Performing String Operations**
   - **Concatenation**: Joining strings together using the `+` operator.
   - **Repetition**: Repeating strings using the `*` operator.
   - Finding the **length** of a string using `len()`.

3. **Using String Formatting Techniques**
   - **f-Strings**: Embedding expressions directly in strings.
   - **`format()` Method**: Inserting variables into strings using placeholders.
   - **Old-style Formatting**: Using `%` placeholders for formatting.

## Practical Examples
- **example_10_01.py** - Palindrome Checker
- **example_10_02.py** - Word Counter

## Quick Exercise
- **excercise_10_01.py** - Write a Python script that takes a string from the user and prints the string in reverse order.

## Further Practice
1. Create a string and print its first and last characters using indexing.
2. Concatenate two strings to create a full name, then print the result.
3. Write a function that takes a string and returns it in uppercase.
4. Format a string to display a user's name and age using an f-string.
