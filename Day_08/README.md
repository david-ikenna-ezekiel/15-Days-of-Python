# Day 08: Control Flow - Loops

## Overview
On Day 8, we’ll dive into loops, which allow you to repeat code multiple times. You’ll learn how to use `for` and `while` loops, create nested loops, and control loop execution with `break` and `continue` statements. By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to handle repetitive tasks efficiently in Python.

## Topics Covered
1. **Using `for` and `while` Loops**
   - **For Loop**: Iterating over sequences like lists, strings, or ranges.
   - **While Loop**: Executing a block of code as long as a condition is true.
   
2. **Nested Loops**
   - Understanding nested loops (loops within loops).
   - Practical applications of nested loops for tasks like iterating over multi-dimensional data.

3. **Controlling Loop Execution with `break` and `continue`**
   - Using `break` to exit a loop prematurely.
   - Using `continue` to skip the current iteration and continue with the next.

## Practical Examples
- **example_08_01.py** - Sum of First N Natural numbers
- **example_08_02.py** - Factorial of numbers

## Quick Exercise
- **excercise_08_01.py** - Write a Python script that takes a list of numbers from the user and prints the largest and smallest numbers in the list

## Further Practice
1. Write a `for` loop that prints each item in a list.
2. Create a `while` loop that counts down from 10 to 1.
3. Write a nested loop to print a simple multiplication table.
4. Use a `for` loop with `continue` to print all numbers from 1 to 10, except for 5.
