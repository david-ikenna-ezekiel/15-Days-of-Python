# Day 04: Data Structures - Lists

## Overview
On Day 4, we’ll dive into lists, one of Python’s most versatile data structures. Lists allow you to store and manage collections of items. Today, you’ll learn how to create, access, modify, and manipulate lists, and explore useful techniques like slicing and list comprehensions.

## Topics Covered
1. **Understanding and Using Lists**
   - Creating a list to store multiple items in a single variable.
   - Accessing items in a list using indexes.
   - Modifying items by index and updating the contents of a list.
   - Adding items to a list with `append()`, `extend()`, and `insert()`.
   - Removing items using `remove()`, `pop()`, and `clear()`.

2. **List Slicing and Comprehensions**
   - **Slicing**: Extracting subsets of a list using start, end, and step indexes.
   - **List Comprehensions**: Creating lists in a concise way with `[expression for item in iterable]`.

## Practical Examples
- **example_04_01.py** - List of Student Names.
- **example_04_02.py** - Finding the Largest and Smallest Numbers.

## Quick Exercise
- **excercise_04_01.py** - Write a Python script that takes a list of words from the user, sorts the list in alphabetical order, and prints the sorted list


## Further Practice
1. Create a list of five favorite movies and print the third movie on the list.
2. Add a new movie to the end of the list, then remove the first movie.
3. Use slicing to create a sublist of the second and third items in your list.
4. Create a list of squares (e.g., `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`) using a list comprehension.
