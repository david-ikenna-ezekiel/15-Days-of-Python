# Day 05: Data Structures - Tuples

## Overview
On Day 5, we’ll explore tuples, an immutable data structure in Python. Tuples are similar to lists but cannot be modified after they’re created. Today, you’ll learn how to create, access, and unpack tuples, and discover when to use them effectively.

## Topics Covered
1. **Understanding and Using Tuples**
   - Creating a tuple to store multiple items in a single, immutable structure.
   - Accessing items in a tuple using indexes.
   - Packing values into a tuple and unpacking them into individual variables.

2. **Immutability of Tuples**
   - Understanding that tuples are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).
   - Benefits and limitations of immutability.
   - Using basic tuple methods like `count()` and `index()`.

3. **Working with Nested Tuples**
   - Creating tuples that contain other tuples (nested tuples).
   - Accessing and working with items inside nested tuples.

## Practical Examples
- **example_05_01.py** - Storing Coordinates.
- **example_05_02.py** - Returning Multiple Values from a Function.

## Quick Exercise
- **excercise_05_01.py** - Write a Python script that takes a tuple of numbers from the user and prints the smallest and largest numbers.

## Further Practice
1. Create a tuple with three numbers and print the second number.
2. Unpack a tuple of three values (e.g., `(x, y, z)`) into three separate variables.
3. Create a nested tuple with a few items and access an item within the nested structure.
4. Write a function that returns multiple values as a tuple, then unpack them when calling the function.
