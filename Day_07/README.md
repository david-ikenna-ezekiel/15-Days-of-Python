# Day 07: Control Flow - Conditional Statements

## Overview
On Day 7, we’ll explore conditional statements in Python, which allow you to control the flow of your program by making decisions based on certain conditions. You’ll learn how to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements, and how to combine conditions to create complex decision structures.

## Topics Covered
1. **Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` Statements**
   - Writing basic `if` statements to perform actions based on conditions.
   - Using `elif` for multiple conditions and `else` for a default action.

2. **Nested Conditions**
   - Creating conditions within conditions (nested `if` statements).
   - Understanding when and how to use nesting effectively for clarity and control.

3. **Combining Conditions with Logical Operators**
   - Using `and`, `or`, and `not` to combine multiple conditions.
   - Examples of applying logical operators to create more complex decision-making structures.

## Practical Examples
- **example_07_01.py** - Grade Classification
- **example_07_02.py** - Checking for Even or odd Number
- **example_07_03.py** - Age Classification

## Quick Exercise
- **excercise_07_01.py** - Write a Python script that takes a number from the user and checks if it is positive, negative, or zero

## Further Practice
1. Write a script to check if a number is within a certain range (e.g., between 10 and 50) using logical operators.
2. Create a basic program that suggests an outfit based on the temperature.
