# Day 02: Variables and Data Types

## Overview
On Day 2, we’ll dive into variables and data types in Python. You’ll learn how to work with different types of data, perform conversions, and use basic arithmetic. By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to store information in variables, interact with users, and perform calculations.

## Topics Covered
1. **Understanding Variables and Naming Conventions**
   - Introduction to variables: storing and accessing data.
   - Rules and best practices for naming variables in Python.

2. **Basic Data Types**
   - Overview of fundamental data types: 
     - **Strings** - Text data.
     - **Integers** - Whole numbers.
     - **Floats** - Decimal numbers.
     - **Booleans** - True or False values.

3. **Type Conversions**
   - Converting data from one type to another (e.g., string to integer).
   - Common functions for type conversion: `int()`, `float()`, `str()`.

4. **Using Input and Output Functions**
   - Taking user input with `input()`.
   - Displaying output with `print()`.

5. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**
   - Performing calculations using `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//` (integer division), and `%` (modulus).
   - Combining variables and operations to solve simple math problems.

## Practical Examples
- **example_02_01.py** - String Concatenation.
- **example_02_02.py** - Arithmetic Operations.
- **example_02_03.py** - Combining Input and Type Conversion.

## Quick Exercise
- **excercise_02_01.py** - Write a Python script that takes the user's height in meters and weight in kilograms as input, calculates their Body Mass Index (BMI), and prints the result.


## Further Practice
1. Create a program that takes two numbers as input, adds them, and displays the result.
2. Write a script that converts a given temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit.
3. Experiment with different data types and try converting between them.
