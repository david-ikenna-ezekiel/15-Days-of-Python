# Day 14: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Overview
On Day 14, we’ll introduce Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a powerful programming paradigm that helps organize code into reusable and logical structures. You’ll learn about creating classes, working with objects, and applying OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to design more structured and modular code using OOP.

## Topics Covered
1. **Understanding OOP Concepts**
   - **Classes**: Blueprints for creating objects, defined using the `class` keyword.
   - **Objects**: Instances of a class that hold data and behavior.
   - **Attributes**: Variables within classes that store object data.
   - **Methods**: Functions within classes that define object behaviors.

2. **Constructors (`__init__` Method)**
   - Using the `__init__` method to initialize attributes when an object is created.
   - Understanding the `self` parameter to refer to the instance of the class.

3. **Inheritance**
   - Deriving new classes from existing ones to promote code reuse.
   - Understanding parent and child classes and using the `super()` function to access parent class methods and attributes.

4. **Polymorphism**
   - Using the same interface for different data types or classes.
   - Understanding method overriding and how polymorphism supports flexible code design.

5. **Encapsulation**
   - Restricting access to certain data or methods within a class.
   - Using private (`_`) and protected (`__`) attributes and methods to manage internal data.


## Practical Examples
- **example_14_01.py** - Building a Library System
- **example_14_02.py** - Creating an Employee Management System

## Quick Exercise
- **excercise_14_01.py** - Write a Python script that defines a class Rectangle with attributes length and width, and methods to calculate the area and perimeter. Create an object of the class and use it to calculate and print the area and perimeter.


## Further Practice
1. Create a `Student` class with a constructor to initialize name and grade, and a method to display details.
2. Write a `Person` class and a derived `Employee` class, adding specific attributes to each.
3. Apply polymorphism by creating two classes with the same method names but different behaviors.
