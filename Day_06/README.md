# Day 06: Data Structures - Dictionaries

## Overview
On Day 6, weâ€™ll explore dictionaries, a powerful data structure in Python that allows you to store data as key-value pairs. Dictionaries are ideal for organizing data with labels, making it easy to access, update, and manage information.

## Topics Covered
1. **Understanding and Using Dictionaries**
   - Creating a dictionary with key-value pairs.
   - Accessing values using keys.
   - Modifying existing items and adding new key-value pairs.
   - Removing items with methods like `pop()` and `del`.

2. **Dictionary Methods and Iteration**
   - Common dictionary methods such as `keys()`, `values()`, and `items()`.
   - Iterating through dictionaries using `for` loops to access keys, values, or both.

3. **Working with Nested Dictionaries**
   - Creating dictionaries within dictionaries to model complex data structures.
   - Accessing and modifying values in nested dictionaries.

## Practical Examples
- **example_05_01.py** - Creating a Phonebook Directory
- **example_05_02.py** - Creating a dictionary of student grades

## Quick Exercise
- **excercise_05_01.py** - Write a Python script that takes a dictionary of items and their prices from the user, then allows the user to input an item name to get its price

## Further Practice
1. Create a dictionary representing a person with keys like `name`, `age`, and `city`.
2. Add a new key-value pair to your dictionary (e.g., `occupation`).
3. Write a script that iterates through a dictionary and prints each key-value pair.
4. Create a nested dictionary representing a student's grades across multiple subjects.
