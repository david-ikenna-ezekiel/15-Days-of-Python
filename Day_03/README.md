# Day 03: Operators and Expressions

## Overview
On Day 3, we’ll explore operators in Python, which allow you to perform calculations, compare values, and create logical expressions. You’ll also learn about operator precedence, which determines the order in which operations are carried out in complex expressions.

## Topics Covered
1. **Types of Operators**
   - **Arithmetic Operators**: Used for basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`).
   - **Comparison Operators**: Used to compare values and return a boolean result (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`).
   - **Logical Operators**: Used to combine multiple conditions (`and`, `or`, `not`).
   - **Assignment Operators**: Used to assign values to variables with shortcuts for math operations (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.).

2. **Operator Precedence**
   - Understanding the order of operations when combining different operators in an expression.
   - Overview of Python’s precedence rules (e.g., `*` and `/` are evaluated before `+` and `-`).
   - Using parentheses to control the order of operations in complex expressions.

## Practical Examples
- **example_03_01.py** - Calculating the area of a circle.
- **example_03_02.py** - Simple Interest Calculation.
- **example_03_03.py** - Logical operations.

## Quick Exercise
- **excercise_03_01.py** - Write a program that takes two numbers and outputs their sum, difference, product, and quotient.


## Further Practice
1. Create a script that checks if a number is between 10 and 50.
2. Experiment with logical operators by combining multiple conditions and observing the results.
